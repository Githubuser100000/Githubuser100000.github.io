    <h2>Mad Scientist arrested for cloning humans</h2>
    <p>On December 27th, 2032. Dr. William Jones was arrested for cloning humans. The US government has put various laws to prevent the cloning of humans. He was charged with human trafficking as well as genetic identity theft. He enslaved his clones to do manual labor. He was caught selling his clones to human traffickers earlier this month. He also collected DNA from various people and committed genetic identity theft. </p>
    <p>Dr. Jones' arrest sparked a debate about cloning humans for manual labor. An anonymous slavery enthusiast happily stated that "Why didn't we start cloning humans sooner. We can bring back slavery, afterall they aren't humans". Many people disagree with this slavery enthusiast. Ethicist Amy stated "Clones are still human beings, just because we made them in a lab doesn't make them less human than the natural made humans". What is your opinion on cloning humans?</p>
