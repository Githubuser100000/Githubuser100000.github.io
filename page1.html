    <h2>The Debate about Genetic Engineering: Ethical or Not?</h2>
    <p>Recently we have been using advanced technnology to tamper with life. We have harvested organs to save lives. We have cured many diseases by using genetic engineering. In recent years a debate has risen among the general public. According to Reverend Frank Smith,"genetic engineering is like doing god's job. We are not supreme beings to tamper with life. Soone enough we will be creating designer babies. We will begin to undervalue human life". Many people share views with Reverend Frank but others disagree. Dr.Am Eoba states that"genetic engineering can possibly save many lives. We can eradicate a lot of diseases with genetic engineering". </p>
    <p>During the international pharmaceutical conference in Paris this topic was brought up. Scientists had a heated debate about how ethical genetic engineering is. An anonymous scientist proposed that the EU should introduce policies that put a restriction what can or can't be genetically modified. What is your opinion on genetic modification? </p>
